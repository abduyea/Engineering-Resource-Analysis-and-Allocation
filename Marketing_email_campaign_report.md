 Timeless Transport Models - Marketing Email Campaign Report 

 Project Objectives
- Identify the email tone that maximizes customer engagement.
- Determine the most effective day of the week to send marketing emails.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve year-round sales consistency.

 Data Overview
 Data Sources
- Email engagement data (Jan - Jun 2004, 94 campaigns)
- Customer order history linked to final emails before orders (43 records)

 Metrics Measured
- Open Rate: Emails opened ÷ Emails sent  
- Click Rate: Clicks ÷ Emails sent  
- Open-to-Click Rate: Clicks ÷ Opens  
- Unsubscribe Rate: Unsubscribes ÷ Emails sent  
- Order Rate: Orders ÷ Emails sent  

 Methodology
The analysis involved calculating the engagement metrics for each email campaign, comparing averages between conversational and urgent tone groups, and examining engagement rates across different send days. Statistical tests (t-tests and ANOVA) were used to assess the significance of differences between groups.

Results and Findings
 Email Tone Comparison (Jan - Jun 2004)
| Metric             | Conversational (A) | Urgent (B) |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Average Open Rate  | 9.80%               | 22.07%     |
| Average Click Rate | 3.50%               | 4.51%      |
| Open-to-Click Rate | 40.91%              | 29.39%     |

Key Findings:
- Urgent tone emails achieved more than double the open rate of conversational emails.
- Click rates were higher with urgent tone emails, indicating increased engagement.
- Conversational emails had a higher open-to-click ratio but lower total engagement.

 Best Day to Send Emails (Mar - Jun 2004)
| Day       | Average Open Rate |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Monday    | 14.94%            |
| Wednesday | 7.72%             |
| Friday    | 6.45%             |

Insights:
- Emails sent on Mondays had the highest open rates, nearly twice that of Fridays.
- Mid-week and Friday emails showed lower engagement, likely due to shifting work priorities and end-of-week fatigue.

Why Monday Performs Better:
Clients are more focused on planning and purchasing at the start of the week.
 Mid-week workload distractions reduce engagement.
Fridays are often reserved for wrapping up tasks and planning weekends, resulting in decreased attention to marketing emails.
